                <h2 class="ncd-section-title">Overview</h2>
                <p>The SEBI Circular dated September 13, 2012, introduced a new cadre of distributors allowed to sell simple and performing mutual
                    fund schemes. This includes postal agents, retired government and semi-government officials, retired teachers, and other individuals
                    with relevant experience, such as bank correspondents.</p>
                <p>Additionally, intermediaries like insurance agents, FD agents, and business correspondents with at least 5 years of experience were
                    also included. AMFI has finalized the registration process for these distributors, specifying eligibility criteria, required documents, and a
                    self-certification declaration for applicants. This cadre is authorized to sell mutual fund schemes as defined in the SEBI circular.</p>
