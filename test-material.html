                <p>From June 1, 2010, AMFI discontinued its Mutual Fund Certification program, including the Basic and Advisor modules. The Mutual
                    Fund Distributors Certification Examination, now conducted by NISM, replaced these tests. The AMFI Refresher Course was also
                    discontinued and replaced by the Continuing Professional Education (CPE) Program for Mutual Fund Distributors, also conducted by
                    NISM.</p>
